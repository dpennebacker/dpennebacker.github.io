Welcome to my HQ. It is a space where students, teachers, peers or the wandering can use as they see fit. This might be your first time viewing the site or nth, but either way, I hope you find it useful. I've been looking for an alternative to Wordpress and hosting through various companies. I think I found it. This page is hosted via GitHub. There is a learning curve but after I dug into the code/files, I was hooked at the simplicity. The fast load times. The simplicity is what drew me here. So explore it. 

Why?
======
Part resource and part landing page for what I teach. This github site is my main hub for projects both digital and tangible. 
Looking for talks? Check out the <a href="https://dpennebacker.github.io/talks/">Talks</a> page. Looking for Google Classrooms for PV? Check out the <a href="https://dpennebacker.github.io/teaching/">Teaching</a> Tab. 

Want your own site?
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
