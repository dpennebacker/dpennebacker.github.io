Welcome to my HQ. It is a space where students, teachers, peers or the wandering can use as they see fit. This might be your first time viewing the site or nth, but either way, I hope you find it useful. I've been looking for an alternative to Wordpress and hosting through various companies. I think I found it. This page is hosted via GitHub. There is a learning curve but after I dug into the code/files, I was hooked at the simplicity. The fast load times. The simplicity is what drew me here. So explore it. 



Why?
======
Part resource and part landing page for what I teach. This github site is my main hub for projects both digital and tangible. 
Looking for talks? Check out the <a href="https://dpennebacker.github.io/talks/">Talks</a> page. Looking for Google Classrooms for PV? Check out the <a href="https://dpennebacker.github.io/teaching/">Teaching</a> Tab. 

Meet The Teacher Night - 2020/2021
======

This year we'll be doing things a bit different. Unfortately I can't make the schedule night in person/digitally. In an effort to inform parents and provide an "in-person" night, I've created videos for each of my 4 courses this year. On 9/30 at 7pm, please use my zoom invitation below my videos to join. It will be an open time for parents to come in and "meet" me in person and ask specific questions about the courses. Thank you!

***PLEASE NOTE THAT VIDEOS WILL BE AVAILABLE SHORTLY. PLEASE ENJOY THIS PLACEHOLDER VIDEO!***
