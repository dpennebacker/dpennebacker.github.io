AP Computer Science Principles offers a multidisciplinary approach to teaching the underlying
principles of computation. The course will introduce students to the creative aspects of programming,
abstractions, algorithms, large data sets, the Internet, cybersecurity concerns, and computing impacts. AP
Computer Science Principles will give students the opportunity to use technology to address real-world
problems and build relevant solutions. Together, these aspects of the course make up a rigorous and rich
curriculum that aims to broaden participation in computer science.of computer programs is used as a context for introducing other important aspects of computer science, including the development and analysis of algorithms, the development and use of fundamental data structures, the study of standard algorithms and typical applications, and the use of logic and formal methods. In addition, the responsible use of these systems is an integral part of the course. AP Computer Science seeks students that are mathematically minded, problem solvers, and have a strong background with computers.
