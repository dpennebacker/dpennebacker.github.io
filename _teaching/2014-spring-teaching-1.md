Computer programs are designed and implemented to solve problems that involve fundamental skills of computer science.
AP Computer Science is built around the development of computer programs to correctly solve a given problem. The programs must
be understandable, adaptable, and if needed, be able to interact with the user. At the same time, the design and implementation of computer programs is used as a context for introducing other important aspects of computer science, including the development and analysis of algorithms, the development and use of fundamental data structures, the study of standard algorithms and typical applications, and the use of logic and formal methods. In addition, the responsible use of these systems is an integral part of the course. AP Computer Science seeks students that are mathematically minded, problem solvers, and have a strong background with computers.
